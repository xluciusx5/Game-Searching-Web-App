         <p id="description">  For the first time, Forza Horizon 5 takes the long-running open-world racing series to Mexico, and it's a sight to behold. FH5 features huge upgrades to graphics over its already-impressive predecessor, a more accomodating campaign with branching paths and a solid narrative, the Forza car list at launch yet, and countless quality-of-life improvements to bring it all together. Forza Horizon 5 was only in development for one additional year over previous entries in the franchise, but enjoys such a massive leap in quality that it feels like it must've taken much longer. </p>
